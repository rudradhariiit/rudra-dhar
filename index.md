## 👋 About Me

I am a PhD student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India, working at the intersection of **Generative AI** and **Software Architecture**. My work explores how large language models can be used to analyze, design, and transform complex software systems.

I am passionate about building intelligent developer tools that support design, modularity, and automation in software engineering.
